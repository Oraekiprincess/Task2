Version control (source control) is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.


Git is a version control system installed locally on the computer. Git allows developers to track changes made to a code, while GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service used for hosting git repositories. You can use Git without GitHub but you can't use GitHub without Git.


Here are three GitHub alternatives: 1) AWS CodeCommit 2) Bitbucket 3) SourceForge.


Git fetch is a command that allows you to download objects from another repository. Git pull is a command that allows you to fetch from and integrate with another repository or local branch. The major difference between git fetch and git pull is that git fetch only downloads the latest changes from the remote repository, while git pull downloads the latest changes and merges them into your current branch.


Rebase is one of Git utilities that specializes in integrating changes from one branch onto another. git rebase <base> is the command to perfom the standard rebase.


git cherry-pick means choosing a commit from one branch and applying it to another branch. the command for it is:( git cherry-pick <commit-hash>)
